# **Wine Clustering Project**  

This project aims to perform **wine clustering** based on various physical and chemical characteristics. We use **dimensionality reduction (PCA)** to facilitate visualization and improve the performance of the **clustering model**, testing three main algorithms: **K-Means**, **MeanShift**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**.  

## **Objectives**  
- Group wines based on their chemical and physical properties.  
- Evaluate model performance using the **silhouette_score**.  
- Visualize clusters in 2D using PCA.  

## **Libraries Used**  
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.  
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.  
- `sklearn`: For clustering algorithms, PCA, and metric calculations.  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.  
- `scipy`: For distance calculations and other auxiliary functions.  

## **Project Structure**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- The dataset is loaded and prepared, with feature scaling applied when necessary to ensure proper model performance.  
- We use **StandardScaler** to standardize the data.  

### **2. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**  
- The **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** algorithm is applied to reduce the datasetâ€™s dimensionality to 2 or 3 principal components, enabling clearer visualization of the clusters.  

### **3. Clustering Algorithms**  
- We implement and compare **K-Means**, **MeanShift**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** to identify patterns in the data.  

### **4. Visualization**  
- **2D Plot**: PCA is used to reduce the data to two components, allowing us to visualize the clusters in a 2D graph.  

### **5. Evaluation Metrics**  
- We use the **silhouette_score** to assess the quality of the clusters generated by the algorithms. This score ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate well-separated and cohesive clusters.  

## **How to Run**  

### **Installation**  
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
